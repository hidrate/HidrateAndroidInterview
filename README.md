# Hidrate Android Interview
There are some bugs that exist in this application. Together, we will fix them and make this the best sample app of all time!

The first bug occurs after clicking the center button. There is a crash. 

The second bug occurs after fixing that crash and clicking the button again. You should be able to navigate to a 2nd page after clicking it, but once you navigate back to the first page, you can no longer navigate to the second page.

The third bug occurs on the second page. Clicking the first button on the list should cause the Composable to recompose and for the button to disappear, but it does not. 

Lastly, although it is a trivial and poorly written app, what are some tests you might write for this application?
